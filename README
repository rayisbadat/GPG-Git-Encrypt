The gpg based scripts are taking from https://gist.github.com/shadowhand/873637
but they used open ssl.


Steps
-----
* Create `~/.config/gitencrypt` and `cd ~/.config/gitencrypt`
* Copy these files there
* Add `GIT_ENCRYPT_RECIPIENT` to your shells environment
* Make sure gpg is configured (good luck)

* in $PROJECT_REPO/.git/config add the following lines ::
    
    [filter "gpg"]
        smudge = ~/.config/gitencrypt/smudge_filter_gpg
        clean = ~/.config/gitencrypt/clean_filter_gpg
    [diff "gpg"]
        textconv = ~/.config/gitencrypt/diff_filter_gpg
    

* In $PROJECT_REPO/.gitattributes add ::

    filter=gpg diff=gpg
    [merge]
        renormalize=true

* git init, git add, git commit 
    * Do --verbose on the add to make sure everythign is setup right
